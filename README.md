# ralph

Autonomous AI coding agent loop runner. Runs plan and build phases in a loop, feeding structured prompts to an AI coding agent in headless mode. Supports multiple backends — currently [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/), and [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot).

## Background

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum pattern](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum) — a technique for running AI coding agents in autonomous loops where each iteration picks up where the last left off. The name comes from Ralph Wiggum's famous line *"I'm helping!"*, which captures the spirit of an agent that cheerfully works through a task list one item at a time, without needing hand-holding between steps.

The pattern works in two phases: **plan** (analyse the codebase against specifications and produce a prioritised implementation plan) and **build** (pick the next item, implement it, run tests, commit, repeat). A shared `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` acts as the handoff between iterations, giving each fresh Claude session the context it needs to continue. An append-only `PROGRESS.md` log captures what each iteration did, what it learned, and what broke — providing a breadcrumb trail for both the human and future iterations.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marc0der/ralph.git
cd ralph
./install.sh
```

This places `ralph` in `~/.local/bin/`, default prompts in `~/.config/ralph/prompts/`, workspace templates in `~/.config/ralph/templates/`, and the devcontainer config in `~/.config/ralph/container/`.

ralph init --prompts                                # also copy prompts for customisation
```

## Sandbox

The sandbox runs your project inside a devcontainer — an isolated environment with Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Node.js 20, SDKMAN, Docker CLI, and development tools pre-installed. The active backend runs as a non-root user with its backend-specific permission-bypass flag enabled.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (rootful) — rootless Docker is not supported
- **devcontainer CLI** — install with `npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`

### Usage

```bash
cd your-project
ralph sandbox              # start or reuse container, drop into zsh
ralph sandbox --rebuild    # rebuild image from scratch (after ralph updates)
ralph sandbox clean        # remove the container for this project
```

Each project gets its own container, automatically reused between sessions. Shell history persists across container recreations via a Docker volume.

### What gets mounted

| Source                    | Target                          | Mode      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| `~/.claude`               | `/home/node/.claude`            | read/write |
| `~/.codex`                | `/home/node/.codex`             | read/write |
| `~/.copilot`              | `/home/node/.copilot`           | read/write |
| `~/.gitconfig`            | `/home/node/.gitconfig`         | readonly  |
| `~/.ssh`                  | `/home/node/.ssh`               | readonly  |
| `~/.config/gh`            | `/home/node/.config/gh`         | readonly  |
| Docker socket             | `/var/run/docker.sock`          | read/write |
| SSH agent socket           | `/tmp/ssh-agent.sock`           | read/write |
| `ralph` binary            | `/usr/local/bin/ralph`          | readonly  |
| ralph config dir           | `/home/node/.config/ralph`      | readonly  |

Optional mounts (`~/.ssh`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot`, SSH agent) are skipped if the source doesn't exist on the host. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GH_TOKEN`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are forwarded into the container when set on the host.

### SDKMAN

SDKMAN is installed but no JDK is pre-installed. If your project uses a `.sdkmanrc`, install the declared JDK inside the sandbox:

```bash
sdk env install
```

## Prompt resolution

Ralph looks for prompts in this order:

1. **Project-local** — `PROMPT_plan.md` / `PROMPT_build.md` in the working directory
2. **Installed defaults** — `~/.config/ralph/prompts/plan.md` / `build.md`

The default prompts reference Anthropic model names (Sonnet, Opus) for subagent selection. If you're using a non-Claude backend, run `ralph init --prompts` to copy the defaults into your project and edit them to suit your backend.

## Project artifacts

Ralph iterations create and maintain these files in your project:

| File                     | Purpose                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CLAUDE.md`              | Operational guardrails for the Claude backend — build commands, conventions, project rules. Read by every iteration to orient the agent. You maintain this file; ralph does not create or modify it |
| `AGENTS.md`              | Operational guardrails for the Codex backend — equivalent of `CLAUDE.md` for codex projects |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Prioritised task list — shared state between iterations       |
| `PROGRESS.md`            | Append-only log of what each iteration did, learned, and broke|
| `specs/`                 | Feature specifications driving the work                       |

**Note:** `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are your project's own configuration files for Claude Code and Codex respectively — ralph reads them but never creates or modifies them. The prompt templates reference both files so each backend gets relevant project-specific guidance.

`PROMPT_plan.md` and `PROMPT_build.md` are optional project-local prompt overrides (see [Prompt resolution](#prompt-resolution)).

### Starting a new goal

When switching to a new goal, clear out stale artifacts first:

```bash
ralph archive                                    # move to .ralph/<timestamp>/
ralph plan -g "New goal"
```

Or if you don't need the history:

```bash
ralph clean                                      # delete artifacts
ralph plan -g "New goal"
```

Archived artifacts are stored under `.ralph/` in your project directory, organised by timestamp.

## Commit conventions

The build phase commits via the `/commit` skill bundled with ralph and scaffolded by `ralph init` into `.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md`. The skill enforces an opinionated style:

- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — `<type>(<scope>): <short imperative subject>`
- **Atomic** — separable concerns become separate commits, even within a single build iteration
- **Selective staging** — only the paths belonging to the current commit are staged; never `git add -A`
- **Optional short body** — up to 3 bulleted lines summarising what was implemented, only when the subject isn't self-explanatory
- Loop-local artifacts (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `PROMPT_*.md`, `.ralph/`) are never staged

The scaffolded skill lives in your project's `.claude/skills/` and is not gitignored by `ralph init` — commit it to share with your team, or edit it locally if you want different conventions.

## Permissions and safety

Ralph runs backends in non-interactive pipe mode, which cannot prompt for tool approval. Each backend has its own permission-bypass flag (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` for Claude, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for Codex), and ralph applies the appropriate one automatically.

**Inside the sandbox** (`$DEVCONTAINER=true`), this is the intended setup — the container's isolation provides a safety boundary, so unrestricted tool access is acceptable.

**Outside a container**, ralph will print a prominent warning on each run. Use `ralph sandbox` to run inside a devcontainer for safer execution.

## Configuration

| Variable           | Default              | Description                     |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `RALPH_BIN_DIR`    | `~/.local/bin`       | Where to install the CLI        |
| `RALPH_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.config/ralph`    | Where to store prompts and container config |

### Model selection

The default model depends on the selected backend:

- `claude` backend: `opus`
- `codex` backend: `gpt-5.2-codex`
- `copilot` backend: `claude-opus-4.7`

The `-m` flag overrides the default for whichever backend is active:

```bash
ralph build -m sonnet          # faster and cheaper (claude backend)
ralph plan -m opus             # better for complex reasoning (claude backend)
ralph build -b codex           # uses gpt-5.2-codex by default
ralph build -b codex -m o3     # override codex model
ralph build -b copilot         # uses claude-opus-4.7 by default
```

## Development

Enter the Nix shell to get development dependencies (bats, shellcheck):

```bash
nix-shell
```

Run tests and lint:

```bash
bats test/
shellcheck ralph install.sh
shellcheck test/*.bats test/test_helper.bash
```

## Troubleshooting

**`claude` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the Claude Code CLI for the `claude` backend. Install it from https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `claude` in your PATH.

**`codex` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the Codex CLI for the `codex` backend. Install it with `npm install -g @openai/codex` — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `codex` in your PATH.

**`copilot` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the GitHub Copilot CLI for the `copilot` backend. Install it with `npm install -g @github/copilot` — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `copilot` in your PATH.

**`ralph` not in PATH after install**
The installer places `ralph` in `~/.local/bin` by default. Ensure this directory is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**Push rejected / diverged branch**
If `git push` fails due to diverged history, pull and resolve conflicts manually, then re-run `ralph build` to continue.

**Resuming after a failed iteration**
Just re-run `ralph build`. It picks up from the current state of `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — no special recovery step is needed.

**Sandbox container is stale or broken**
Remove it and start fresh:
```bash
ralph sandbox clean
ralph sandbox
```

**Sandbox image needs updating**
After updating ralph, rebuild the container image:
```bash
ralph sandbox --rebuild
```

**`devcontainer` CLI not installed**
Install it with npm:
```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

**`sandbox` fails with `invalid mount config for type "bind": ... operation not supported`**

Ralph bind-mounts `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` into the container so git operations can reuse your host's ssh-agent. This fails when the socket lives at a path the Docker runtime's VM cannot bind-mount — either because the path is outside the VM's shared filesystem, or because the socket is a kernel-managed endpoint (e.g. a launchd-created socket on macOS) that doesn't survive the virtfs passthrough.

The symptom is a `docker run` error naming the SSH agent path, for example:

```
invalid mount config for type "bind": stat /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.XXXXXX/Listeners: operation not supported
```

When this happens, depends on your setup:

- **macOS + Colima** — affected. Colima runs Docker inside a Lima VM that only mounts `$HOME` by default, and macOS's default `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` points at a launchd socket under `/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.*` which is neither mounted nor bind-mountable.
- **macOS + Docker Desktop** — not typically affected. Docker Desktop intercepts `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and provides a magic `/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock` passthrough.
- **macOS + Rancher Desktop / OrbStack / other Lima-based runtimes** — likely affected for the same reason as Colima.
- **Linux** — not affected. Docker runs natively on the host filesystem.

Workaround: run ralph with an empty `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` so the mount is skipped. Git inside the container will fall back to the read-only `~/.ssh` bind mount (fine for key-based auth without a passphrase):

```bash
SSH_AUTH_SOCK="" ralph sandbox
```
